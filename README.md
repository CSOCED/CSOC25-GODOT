## Godot

### Setup

Godot might be one of the easiest pieces of software to set up, and the interesting part is that it is open-source and lightweight. Just head over to Godot's [official download page](https://godotengine.org/download) and grab the ~65 MB zip file. Extract it on your PC (placing it on your desktop would be a good idea for easy access), and you are good to go.

### Programming

Godot has its own programming language, **GDScript**, which is quite similar to Python, and there is an inbuilt code editor in Godot, so no need for VS Code if you are using Godot (unless you are a VS Code addict).

You can also use **C#** and **C++** if you use the .NET version of Godot.

Now, one of the most significant concepts in Godot is the concept of **nodes**. Everythingâ€”a button, a character, a soundâ€”is a node. Nodes are like blocks, and you build with them to get your game to function. It may seem strange at first, but once you get it, it's incredibly powerful and enjoyable.

To make it easier for you to understand this, we have a video that covers all the prominent nodes in Godot 4 â€” what they're for, and when you should be using them. Don't stress if it's overwhelming right now â€” we'll get through it step by step. Just get the basic idea of nodes and the Godot ecosystem for now.
